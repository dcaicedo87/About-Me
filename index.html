  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a passionate programmer who takes pride in creating <strong>value through technology</strong>. Ever since coding “Hello World”, programming has become one of my strongest passions. I’m excited for the oncoming challenges ahead and what questions they will bring. I believe with enough dedication and perseverance, anything can be achieved.</p>
  <p>What's truly important to me is to <strong>grow as a developer</strong>. Creating something out of nothing has intrigued me ever since I could remember. To be able to design possibilities out of thought is powerful. Challenging myself daily will allow me to grow my skills needed to succeed in my field.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I’m originally from Cali, Colombia where I lived for nine years of my life where then I moved to the United States. Speaking multiple languages has allowed me to appreciate the dedication needed to maintain multiple dialects, including learning new ones. I believe in <strong>strong family bonds</strong> and developing new relationships to grow as a team. Through teamwork we will learn from each other to produce the best results we alone would have struggled to achieve.</p>
